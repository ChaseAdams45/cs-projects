# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
My idea was very similar to the given one as I had the idea to keep track of corner locations and use math and the side lengths to find the starting position of the next hexagon.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
I think the hexagons are supposed to reprsent the rooms and that tesselating the hexagons is an analogy or connecting rooms with hallways.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
I would write a method to make a room first since in lab we started with hexagons. Then I would write methods to connect them with hallways.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
A hallway connects rooms. It is like having nodes and linking them together with hallways.
